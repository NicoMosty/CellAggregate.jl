   abstract = {Tissue engineering has enabled the creation of strategies and solutions in the biomedical area, which have widely benefited patients suffering from different conditions. In recent years, new technologies and advances in related fields have increased the effectiveness of the treatments developed in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine and have marked a milestone in the history of medicine. New discoveries have provided a wider understanding of the biology of tissues and organs, hand in hand with the fourth industrial revolution, particularly, the disruptive technologies for manufacturing, a new possibility may be within reach in the next years: to fabricate organs that are functionally equivalent to physiological ones. This article presents a general revision of the role of tissue engineering and the implementation of additive manufacturing technology. The analysis is under the light of a simple molecular biology interpretation of the key aspects, main successes, and major challenges. This revision summarizes how the biology of tissues can be reinterpreted in an engineering framework as the differential adhesion hypothesis (DAH), which allows modelling a wide range of fundamental interactions among cells. Some models for tissue morphogenesis based on contact interaction and signaling agents are presented and analyzed in the context of the current state of the art of 3D-bioprinting technology. Finally, potential directions for future research and innovation development in this area are proposed.},

   abstract = {Self-assembly is a fundamental process that drives structural organization in both inanimate and living systems. It is in the course of self-assembly of cells and tissues in early development that the organism and its parts eventually acquire their final shape. Even though developmental patterning through self-assembly is under strict genetic control it is clear that ultimately it is physical mechanisms that bring about the complex structures. Here we show, both experimentally and by using computer simulations, how tissue liquidity can be used to build tissue constructs of prescribed geometry in vitro. Spherical aggregates containing many thousands of cells, which form because of tissue liquidity, were implanted contiguously into biocompatible hydrogels in circular geometry. Depending on the properties of the gel, upon incubation, the aggregates either fused into a toroidal 3D structure or their constituent cells dispersed into the surrounding matrix. The model simulations, which reproduced the experimentally observed shapes, indicate that the control parameter of structure evolution is the aggregate-gel interfacial tension. The model-based analysis also revealed that the observed toroidal structure represents a metastable state of the cellular system, whose lifetime depends on the magnitude of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Thus, these constructs can be made long-lived. We suggest that spherical aggregates composed of organ-specific cells may be used as ''bio-ink'' in the evolving technology of organ printing.},

   abstract = {A long-standing problem in tissue engineering is the biofabrication of perfusable tissue constructs that can be readily connected to the patient's vasculature. It was partially solved by three-dimensional (3D) printing of sacrificial material (e.g., hydrogel) strands: upon incorporation in another cell-laden hydrogel, the strands were removed, leaving behind perfusable channels. Their complexity, however, did not match that of the native vasculature. Here, we propose to use multicellular spheroids as a sacrificial material and investigate their potential benefits in the context of 3D bioprinting of cell aggregates and/or cell-laden hydrogels. Our study is based on computer simulations of postprinting cellular rearrangements. The computational model of the biological system is built on a cubic lattice, whereas its evolution is simulated using the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm. The simulations describe structural changes in three types of tissue constructs: a tube made of a single cell type, a tube made of two cell types, and a cell-laden hydrogel slab that incorporates a branching tube. In all three constructs, the lumen is obtained after the elimination of the sacrificial cell population. Our study suggests that sacrificial cell spheroids (sacrospheres) enable one to print tissue constructs outfitted with a finer and more complex network of channels than the ones obtained so far. Moreover, cellular interactions might give rise to a tissue microarchitecture that lies beyond the bioprinter's resolution. Although more expensive than inert materials, sacrificial cells have the potential to bring further progress towards the biofabrication of fully vascularized tissue substitutes.},

   abstract = {The cellular Potts model (CPM) is a robust, cell-level methodology for simulation of biological tissues and morphogenesis. Both tissue physiology and morphogenesis depend on diffusion of chemical morphogens in the extra-cellular fluid or matrix (ECM). Standard diffusion solvers applied to the cellular potts model use finite difference methods on the underlying CPM lattice. However, these methods produce a diffusing field tied to the underlying lattice, which is inaccurate in many biological situations in which cell or ECM movement causes advection rapid compared to diffusion. Finite difference schemes suffer numerical instabilities solving the resulting advection-diffusion equations. To circumvent these problems we simulate advection diffusion within the framework of the CPM using off-lattice finite-difference methods. We define a set of generalized fluid particles which detach advection and diffusion from the lattice. Diffusion occurs between neighboring fluid particles by local averaging rules which approximate the Laplacian. Directed spin flips in the CPM handle the advective movement of the fluid particles. A constraint on relative velocities in the fluid explicitly accounts for fluid viscosity. We use the CPM to solve various diffusion examples including multiple instantaneous sources, continuous sources, moving sources, and different boundary geometries and conditions to validate our approximation against analytical and established numerical solutions. We also verify the CPM results for Poiseuille flow and Taylor-Aris dispersion. © 2005 The American Physical Society.},

To address these aspects, we proposes a novel mathematical model, where a reaction-diffusion system is discretely expressed at a single cell level and combined with a 3D vertex model. To investigate complex phenomena emerging from the coupling of patterning and deformation, as an example, we employed an activator-inhibitor system and converted the activator concentration of individual cells into their growth rate. Despite the simplicity of the model, by growing a monolayer cell vesicle, the coupling system provided rich morphological dynamics such as undulation, tubulation, and branching. Interestingly, the morphological variety depends on the difference in time scales between patterning and deformation, and can be partially understood by the intrinsic hysteresis in the activator-inhibitor system with domain growth. Importantly, the model can be applied to 3D multicellular dynamics that couple the reaction-diffusion patterning with various cell behaviors, such as deformation, rearrangement, division, apoptosis, differentiation, and proliferation. Thus, the results demonstrate the significant advantage of the proposed model as well as the biophysical importance of exploring spatiotemporal dynamics of the coupling phenomena of patterning and deformation in 3D space.},

   abstract = {Colorectal tumors originate and develop within intestinal crypts. Even though some of the essential phenomena that characterize crypt structure and dynamics have been effectively described in the past, the relation between the differentiation process and the overall crypt homeostasis is still only partially understood. We here investigate this relation and other important biological phenomena by introducing a novel multiscale model that combines a morphological description of the crypt with a gene regulation model: the emergent dynamical behavior of the underlying gene regulatory network drives cell growth and differentiation processes, linking the two distinct spatio-temporal levels. The model relies on a few a priori assumptions, yet accounting for several key processes related to crypt functioning, such as: dynamic gene activation patterns, stochastic differentiation, signaling pathways ruling cell adhesion properties, cell displacement, cell growth, mitosis, apoptosis and the presence of biological noise. We show that this modeling approach captures the major dynamical phenomena that characterize the regular physiology of crypts, such as cell sorting, coordinate migration, dynamic turnover, stem cell niche correct positioning and clonal expansion. All in all, the model suggests that the process of stochastic differentiation might be sufficient to drive the crypt to homeostasis, under certain crypt configurations. Besides, our approach allows to make precise quantitative inferences that, when possible, were matched to the current biological knowledge and it permits to investigate the role of gene-level perturbations, with reference to cancer development. We also remark the theoretical framework is general and may be applied to different tissues, organs or organisms. © 2014 Graudenzi et al.},

Even within genetically homogeneous populations, complex dynamics, such as population oscillations or the emergence of specific metabolic and/or proliferative patterns, may arise, and this aspect is highly amplified in systems characterized by extreme heterogeneity. To investigate the conditions and mechanisms that link metabolic processes to cell population dynamics, we here employ a previously introduced multi-scale model of multi-cellular system, named FBCA (Flux Balance Analysis with Cellular Automata), which couples biomass accumulation, simulated via Flux Balance Analysis of a metabolic network, with the simulation of population and spatial dynamics via Cellular Potts Models. In this work, we investigate the influence that different modes of nutrients diffusion within the system may have on the emerging behaviour of cell populations. In our model, metabolic communication among cells is allowed by letting secreted metabolites to diffuse over the lattice, in addition to diffusion of nutrients from given sources. The inclusion of the diffusion processes in the model proved its effectiveness in characterizing plausible biological scenarios.},

   abstract = {An emerging approach in biofabrication is the creation of 3D tissue constructs through scaffold-free, cell spheroid-only methods. The basic mechanism in this technology is spheroid fusion, which is driven by the minimization of energy, the same biophysical mechanism that governs spheroid formation. However, other factors such as oxygen and metabolite accessibility within spheroids impact on spheroid properties and their ability to form larger-scale structures. The goal of our work is to develop a simulation platform eventually capable of predicting the conditions that minimize metabolism-related cell loss within spheroids. To describe the behavior and dynamic properties of the cells in response to their neighbors and to transient nutrient concentration fields, we developed a hybrid discrete-continuous heuristic model, combining a cellular Potts-type approach with field equations applied to a randomly populated spheroid cross-section of prescribed cell-type constituency. This model allows for the description of: (i) cellular adhesiveness and motility; (ii) interactions with concentration fields, including diffusivity and oxygen consumption; and (iii) concentration-dependent, stochastic cell dynamics, driven by metabolite-dependent cell death. Our model readily captured the basic steps of spheroid-based biofabrication (as specifically dedicated to scaffold-free bioprinting), including intra-spheroid cell sorting (both in 2D and 3D implementations), spheroid defect closure, and inter-spheroid fusion. Moreover, we found that when hypoxia occurring at the core of the spheroid was set to trigger cell death, this was amplified upon spheroid fusion, but could be mitigated by external oxygen supplementation. In conclusion, optimization and further development of scaffold-free bioprinting techniques could benefit from our computational model which is able to simultaneously account for both cellular dynamics and metabolism in constructs obtained by scaffold-free biofabrication.},

Such efforts are being undertaken in many laboratories around the world. Numerous approaches are pursued, such as those based on the use of natural or artificial scaffolds, decellularized cadaveric extracellular matrices and, most lately, bioprinting. To be successful in this endeavor, it is crucial to provide in vitro micro-environmental clues for the cells resembling those in the organism. Therefore, scaffolds, populated with differentiated cells or stem cells, of increasing complexity and sophistication are being fabricated. However, no matter how sophisticated scaffolds are, they can cause problems stemming from their degradation, eliciting immunogenic reactions and other a priori unforeseen complications. It is also being realized that ultimately the best approach might be to rely on the self-assembly and self-organizing properties of cells and tissues and the innate regenerative capability of the organism itself, not just simply prepare tissue and organ structures in vitro followed by their implantation. Here we briefly review the different strategies for the fabrication of three-dimensional biological structures, in particular bioprinting.

However, this technology was limited to the printing of two-dimensional (2D) tissue constructs. Here we describe the use of thermosensitive gels to generate sequential layers for cell printing. The ability to drop cells on previously printed successive layers provides a real opportunity for the realization of three-dimensional (3D) organ printing. Organ printing will allow us to print complex 3D organs with computer-controlled, exact placing of different cell types, by a process that can be completed in several minutes. To demonstrate the feasibility of this novel technology, we showed that cell aggregates can be placed in the sequential layers of 3D gels close enough for fusion to occur. We estimated the optimum minimal thickness of the gel that can be reproducibly generated by dropping the liquid at room temperature onto a heated substrate. Then we generated cell aggregates with the corresponding (to the minimal thickness of the gel) size to ensure a direct contact between printed cell aggregates during sequential printing cycles. Finally, we demonstrated that these closely-placed cell aggregates could fuse in two types of thermosensitive 3D gels. Taken together, these data strongly support the feasibility of the proposed novel organ-printing technology. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Specifically, we treat the cellular aggregates and the surrounding hydrogels as two immiscible complex fluids in the time scale comparable to cellular aggregate fusion and then develop an effective mean-field potential that incorporates the long-range, attractive interaction between cells as well as the short-range, repulsive interaction due to immiscibility between the cell and the hydrogel. We then implement the model using a high order spectral method to simulate the making of a set of tissues/organs in simple yet fundamental geometries like a ring, a sheet of tissues, and a Y-shaped, bifurcating vascular junction by the layer-by-layer deposition of spheroidal cellular clusters in the bioprinting technology. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Three dimensional (3D) bioprinting is a promising approach to form tissue engineering constructs (TECs) via positioning biomaterials, growth factors, and cells with controlled spatial distribution due to its layer-by-layer manufacturing nature. Hybrid TECs composed of relatively rigid porous scaffolds for structural and mechanical integrity and soft hydrogels for cell- and growth factor-loading have a tremendous potential to tissue regeneration under mechanical loading. However, despite excessive progress in the field, the current 3D bioprinting techniques and systems fall short in integration of such soft and rigid multifunctional components. Here we present a novel 3D hybrid bioprinting technology (Hybprinter) and its capability enabling integration of soft and rigid components for TECs. Hybprinter employs digital light processing-based stereolithography (DLP-SLA) and molten material extrusion techniques for soft and rigid materials, respectively. In this study, poly-ethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) and poly-(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) were used as a model material for soft hydrogel and rigid scaffold, respectively. It was shown that geometrical accuracy, swelling ratio and mechanical properties of the hydrogel component can be tailored by DLP-SLA module. We have demonstrated the printability of variety of complex hybrid construct designs using Hybprinter technology and characterized the mechanical properties and functionality of such constructs. The compressive mechanical stiffness of a hybrid construct (90% hydrogel) was significantly higher than hydrogel itself (∼6 MPa versus 100 kPa). In addition, viability of cells incorporated within the bioprinted hybrid constructs was determined approximately 90%. Furthermore, a functionality of a hybrid construct composed of porous scaffold with an embedded hydrogel conduit was characterized for vascularized tissue engineering applications. High material diffusion and high cell viability in about 2.5 mm distance surrounding the conduit indicated that culture media effectively diffused through the conduit and fed the cells. The results suggest that the developed technology is potent to form functional TECs composed of rigid and soft biomaterials.},

The microtissues and tissue spheroids are living materials with certain measurable, evolving and potentially controllable composition, material and biological properties. Closely placed tissue spheroids undergo tissue fusion - a process that represents a fundamental biological and biophysical principle of developmental biology-inspired directed tissue self-assembly. It is possible to engineer small segments of an intraorgan branched vascular tree by using solid and lumenized vascular tissue spheroids. Organ printing could dramatically enhance and transform the field of tissue engineering by enabling large-scale industrial robotic biofabrication of living human organ constructs with "built-in" perfusable intraorgan branched vascular tree.

   abstract = {Bioprinting allows the fabrication of living constructs with custom-made architectures by spatially controlled deposition of multiple bioinks. This is important for the generation of tissue, such as osteochondral tissue, which displays a zonal composition in the cartilage domain supported by the underlying subchondral bone. Challenges in fabricating functional grafts of clinically relevant size include the incorporation of cues to guide specific cell differentiation and the generation of sufficient cells, which is hard to obtain with conventional cell culture techniques. A novel strategy to address these demands is to combine bioprinting with microcarrier technology. This technology allows for the extensive expansion of cells, while they form multi-cellular aggregates, and their phenotype can be controlled. In this work, living constructs were fabricated via bioprinting of cell-laden microcarriers. Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-laden polylactic acid microcarriers, obtained via static culture or spinner flask expansion, were encapsulated in gelatin methacrylamide-gellan gum bioinks, and the printability of the composite material was studied. This bioprinting approach allowed for the fabrication of constructs with high cell concentration and viability. Microcarrier encapsulation improved the compressive modulus of the hydrogel constructs, facilitated cell adhesion, and supported osteogenic differentiation and bone matrix deposition by MSCs. Bilayered osteochondral models were fabricated using microcarrier-laden bioink for the bone compartment. These findings underscore the potential of this new microcarrier-based biofabrication approach for bone and osteochondral constructs.},

A manifestation of differential adhesion is tissue liquidity and a measure for it is tissue surface tension. In terms of this property, DAH correctly predicts global developmental tissue patterns. However, it provides little information on how these patterns arise from the movement and shape changes of cells. We provide strong qualitative and quantitative support for tissue liquidity both in true developmental context and in vitro assays. We follow the movement and characteristic shape changes of individual cells in the course of specific tissue rearrangements leading to liquid-like configurations. Finally, we relate the measurable tissue-liquid properties to molecular entities, whose direct determination under realistic three-dimensional culture conditions is not possible. Our findings confirm the usefulness of tissue liquidity and provide the scientific underpinning for a novel tissue engineering technology. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture techniques are a recent innovation developed to address the shortcomings of adherent cell culture. While several techniques for generating tissue analogues in vitro have been developed, these methods are frequently complex, expensive to establish, require specialized equipment, and are generally limited by compatibility with only certain cell types. Here, we describe a rapid and flexible protocol for aggregating cells into multicellular 3D spheroids of consistent size that is compatible with growth of a variety of tumor and normal cell lines. We utilize varying concentrations of serum and methyl cellulose (MC) to promote anchorage-independent spheroid generation and prevent the formation of cell monolayers in a highly reproducible manner. Optimal conditions for individual cell lines can be achieved by adjusting MC or serum concentrations in the spheroid formation medium. The 3D spheroids generated can be collected for use in a wide range of applications, including cell signaling or gene expression studies, candidate drug screening, or in the study of cellular processes such as tumor cell invasion and migration. The protocol is also readily adapted to generate clonal spheroids from single cells, and can be adapted to assess anchorage-independent growth and anoikis-resistance. Overall, our protocol provides an easily modifiable method for generating and utilizing 3D cell spheroids in order to recapitulate the 3D microenvironment of tissues and model the in vivo growth of normal and tumor cells.},

Preparation of cell aggregates is one of the important steps in 3D tissue engineering technology, particularly in organ printing.

The size and viability of the aggregates obtained at different initial cell densities and pre-culture duration were compared. The proliferative ability of the cell aggregates and their ability to spread in culture plates were also investigated. In both methods, the optimum average size of the aggregates was less than 500 μm. CT aggregates were smaller than HD aggregates. 5,000 cells per drop HD aggregates showed a marked ability to attach and spread on the culture surface. The proliferative ability reduced when the initial cell density was increased. Comparing these methods, we found that the HD method having better size controlling ability as well as enhanced ability to maintain higher rates of viability, spreading, and proliferation. In conclusion, smaller HD aggregates might be a suitable choice as building blocks for making bioink particles in bioprinting technique.},

Post-printing structure formation is an autonomous process governed by fundamental biological organizing principles. As the quantitative formulation of such principles is notoriously difficult, bioprinting remains largely a trial and error approach. To address this problem, specifically in extrusion bioprinting, we have recently developed an effective computational method, the cellular particle dynamics (CPDs). We have demonstrated the predictive power of CPD in cases of simple printed constructs prepared with spherical multicellular bioink units. Here we generalize CPD to the important practical case of tubular grafts printed with cylindrical bioink units by taking into account the realistic experimental situation in which the length and the volume of the cylinders decrease post-printing. Based on our results, we provide a set of instructions for the use of CPD simulations to directly predict tubular graft formation without the need to carry out the corresponding complex and expensive control experiments. Using these instructions allows the efficient and timely biofabrication of tubular organ structures. A particularly instructive outcome of our analysis is that building tubular organ structures, such as vascular grafts by bioprinting can be done considerably faster by using cylindrical rather than spherical bionk units.},

The computational complexity of the model means that current serial implementations restrict the size of simulation to a level well below biological relevance. Parallelization on computing clusters enables scaling the size of the simulation but marginally addresses computational speed due to the limited memory bandwidth between nodes. In this paper we present new data-parallel algorithms and data structures for simulating the Cellular Potts Model on graphics processing units. Our implementations handle most terms in the Hamiltonian, including cell-cell adhesion constraint, cell volume constraint, cell surface area constraint, and cell haptotaxis. We use fine level checkerboards with lock mechanisms using atomic operations to enable consistent updates while maintaining a high level of parallelism. A new data-parallel memory allocation algorithm has been developed to handle cell division. Tests show that our implementation enables simulations of >106 cells with lattice sizes of up to 2563 on a single graphics card. Benchmarks show that our implementation runs ∼80× faster than serial implementations, and ∼5× faster than previous parallel implementations on computing clusters consisting of 25 nodes. The wide availability and economy of graphics cards mean that our techniques will enable simulation of realistically sized models at a fraction of the time and cost of previous implementations and are expected to greatly broaden the scope of CPM applications. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

BSim includes reference implementations of many bacterial traits to enable the quick development of new models partially built from existing ones. Unlike existing modeling tools, BSim fully considers spatial aspects of a model allowing for the description of intricate micro-scale structures, enabling the modeling of bacterial behavior in more realistic three-dimensional, complex environments. The new opportunities that BSim opens are illustrated through several diverse examples covering: spatial multicellular computing, modeling complex environments, population dynamics of the lac operon, and the synchronization of genetic oscillators. BSim is open source software that is freely available from http://bsim-bccs.sf.net and distributed under the Open Source Initiative (OSI) recognized MIT license. Developer documentation and a wide range of example simulations are also available from the website. BSim requires Java version 1.6 or higher. © 2012 Gorochowski et al.},

   abstract = {Skin is a complex organ tasked with, among other functions, protecting the body from the outside world. Its outermost protective layer, the epidermis, is comprised of multiple cell layers that are derived from a single-layered ectoderm during development. Using a new stochastic, multi-scale computational modelling framework, the anisotropic subcellular element method, we investigate the role of cellmorphology and biophysical cell-cell interactions in the formation of this layered structure. This three-dimensional framework describes interactions between collections of hundreds to thousands of cells and (i) accounts for intracellular structure and morphology, (ii) easily incorporates complex cell-cell interactions and (iii) can be efficiently implemented on parallel architectures. We use this approach to construct a model of the developing epidermis that accounts for the internal polarity of ectodermal cells and their columnar morphology. Using this model, we show that cell detachment, which has been previously suggested to have a role in this process, leads to unpredictable, randomized stratification and that this cannot be abrogated by adjustment of cell-cell adhesion interaction strength. Polarized distribution of cell adhesion proteins, motivated by epithelial polarization, can however eliminate this detachment, and in conjunction with asymmetric cell division lead to robust and predictable development.},

   abstract = {Driven by the availability of experimental data and ability to simulate a biological scale which is of immediate interest, the cellular scale is fast emerging as an ideal candidate for middle-out modelling. As with 'bottom-up' simulation approaches, cellular level simulations demand a high degree of computational power, which in large-scale simulations can only be achieved through parallel computing. The flexible large-scale agent modelling environment (FLAME) is a template driven framework for agent-based modelling (ABM) on parallel architectures ideally suited to the simulation of cellular systems. It is available for both high performance computing clusters (www.flame.ac.uk) and GPU hardware (www.flamegpu.com) and uses a formal specification technique that acts as a universal modelling format. This not only creates an abstraction from the underlying hardware architectures, but avoids the steep learning curve associated with programming them. In benchmarking tests and simulations of advanced cellular systems, FLAME GPU has reported massive improvement in performance over more traditional ABM frameworks. This allows the time spent in the development and testing stages of modelling to be drastically reduced and creates the possibility of real-time visualisation for simple visual face-validation. © The Author 2010.

   abstract = {Microbial biofilms are complex, self-organized communities of bacteria, which employ physiological cooperation and spatial organization to increase both their metabolic efficiency and their resistance to changes in their local environment. These properties make biofilms an attractive target for engineering, particularly for the production of chemicals such as pharmaceutical ingredients or biofuels, with the potential to significantly improve yields and lower maintenance costs. Biofilms are also a major cause of persistent infection, and a better understanding of their organization could lead to new strategies for their disruption. Despite this potential, the design of synthetic biofilms remains a major challenge, due to the complex interplay between transcriptional regulation, intercellular signaling, and cell biophysics. Computational modeling could help to address this challenge by predicting the behavior of synthetic biofilms prior to their construction; however, multiscale modeling has so far not been achieved for realistic cell numbers. This paper presents a computational method for modeling synthetic microbial biofilms, which combines three-dimensional biophysical models of individual cells with models of genetic regulation and intercellular signaling. The method is implemented as a software tool (CellModeller), which uses parallel Graphics Processing Unit architectures to scale to more than 30,000 cells, typical of a 100 μm diameter colony, in 30 min of computation time.},

   abstract = {Motivation: Biological system behaviors are often the outcome of complex interactions among a very large number of cells and their biotic and abiotic environment. Computational biologists attempt to understand, predict, and manipulate biological system behavior through mathematical modeling and computer simulation. Discrete agent based modeling (in combination with high-resolution grids to model the extracellular environment) is a popular approach for building biological system models. However, the computational complexity of this approach forces computational biologists to resort to coarser resolution approaches to simulate large biological systems. High-performance parallel computers have the potential to address the computing challenge, but writing efficient software for parallel computers is difficult and time consuming. Results: We have developed Biocellion, a high-performance software framework, to solve this computing challenge using parallel computers. In order to support a wide range of multicellular biological system models, Biocellion asks users to provide their model specifics by filling the function body of pre-defined model routines. Using Biocellion, modelers without parallel computing expertise can efficiently exploit parallel computers with less effort than writing sequential programs from scratch. We simulate cell sorting, microbial patterning, and a bacterial system in soil aggregate as case studies.

Cells sense and respond to mechanical, chemical and electrical environmental stimuli with a range of behaviors, including dynamic changes in morphology and mechanical properties, chemical uptake and secretion, cell differentiation, proliferation, death, or migration. Modeling and simulation of such dynamic phenomena poses a number of computational challenges. A modeling language to describe cellular dynamics must be able to naturally represent complex intra and extra-cellular spatial structures, and coupled mechanical, chemical and electrical processes. In order to be useful to domain experts, a modeling language should be based on concepts, terms and principles native to the problem domain. A compiler must then be able to generate an executable model from this physically motivated description. Finally, an executable model must efficiently calculate the time evolution of such dynamic and inhomogeneous phenomena. We present a spatial hybrid systems modeling language, compiler and mesh-free Lagrangian based simulation engine which will enable domain experts to define models using natural, biologically motivated constructs and to simulate time evolution of coupled cellular, mechanical and chemical processes acting on a time varying number of cells and their environment.},

This article discusses its implementation for a pair of two-dimensional models, and compares the typical performance that can be expected between running cellGPU entirely on the CPU versus its performance when running on a range of commercial and server-grade graphics cards.

To this end, cell behavioural models addressing the multi-cellular level have to be semantically linked with mechanistic molecular models. These requirements have to be met by flexible software workflows solving the issues of different time scales, inter-model variable referencing, and flexible sub-model embedding. Results: We developed a novel software workflow (EPISIM) for the semantic integration of Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) based quantitative models in multi-scaled tissue models and simulations. This workflow allows to import and access SBML based models. SBML model species, reactions and parameters are semantically integrated in cell behavioural models (CBM) represented by graphical process diagrams. By this, cellular states like proliferation and differentiation can be flexibly linked to gene-regulatory or biochemical reaction networks. For a multi-scale agent-based tissue simulation executable code is automatically generated where different time scales of imported SBML models and CBM have been mapped. We demonstrate the capabilities of the novel software workflow by integrating Tyson's cell cycle model in our model of human epidermal tissue homeostasis. Finally, we show the semantic interplay of the different biological scales during tissue simulation.

Code development has been driven by two initial applications: cardiac electrophysiology and cancer development. A large number of cardiac electrophysiology studies have been enabled and performed, including high-performance computational investigations of defibrillation on realistic human cardiac geometries. New models for the initiation and growth of tumours have been developed. In particular, cell-based simulations have provided novel insight into the role of stem cells in the colorectal crypt. Chaste is constantly evolving and is now being applied to a far wider range of problems. The code provides modules for handling common scientific computing components, such as meshes and solvers for ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs). Re-use of these components avoids the need for researchers to 're-invent the wheel' with each new project, accelerating the rate of progress in new applications.

In particular, specific programming skills are needed for GPU programming. Therefore, the development of an easy-to-use computational architecture, which utilizes GPU for parallel computing and provides intuitive interfaces for simple implementation, is needed so that general scientists can perform GPU simulations without knowing much about the GPU architecture. Here, we introduce ParaCells, a cell-centered GPU simulation architecture for NVIDIA compute unified device architecture (CUDA). ParaCells was designed as a versatile architecture that connects the user logic (in C++) with NVIDIA CUDA runtime and is specific to the modeling of multi-cellular systems. An advantage of ParaCells is its object-oriented model declaration, which allows it to be widely applied to many biological systems through the combination of basic biological concepts. We test ParaCells with two applications. Both applications are significantly faster when compared with sequential as well as parallel OpenMP and OpenACC implementations.

Tissue-scale dynamics emerge from systems of many interacting cells as they respond to and influence their microenvironment. The ideal “virtual laboratory” for such multicellular systems simulates both the biochemical microenvironment (the “stage”) and many mechanically and biochemically interacting cells (the “players” upon the stage). PhysiCell—physics-based multicellular simulator—is an open source agent-based simulator that provides both the stage and the players for studying many interacting cells in dynamic tissue microenvironments. It builds upon a multi-substrate biotransport solver to link cell phenotype to multiple diffusing substrates and signaling factors. It includes biologically-driven sub-models for cell cycling, apoptosis, necrosis, solid and fluid volume changes, mechanics, and motility “out of the box.” The C++ code has minimal dependencies, making it simple to maintain and deploy across platforms. PhysiCell has been parallelized with OpenMP, and its performance scales linearly with the number of cells. Simulations up to 105-106cells are feasible on quad-core desktop workstations; larger simulations are attainable on single HPC compute nodes. We demonstrate PhysiCell by simulating the impact of necrotic core biomechanics, 3-D geometry, and stochasticity on the dynamics of hanging drop tumor spheroids and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. We demonstrate stochastic motility, chemical and contact-based interaction of multiple cell types, and the extensibility of PhysiCell with examples in synthetic multicellular systems (a “cellular cargo delivery” system, with application to anti-cancer treatments), cancer heterogeneity, and cancer immunology.

Collective cell motion of eukaryotic cells often includes interactions that result in polar alignment of cell velocities, while bacterial patterns typically show features of apolar velocity alignment. For analysing the population-scale effects of these different alignment mechanisms, various on- and off-lattice agent-based models have been introduced. However, discriminating model-specific artefacts from general features of collective cell motion is challenging. In this work, we focus on equivalence criteria at the population level to compare on- and off-lattice models. In particular, we define prototypic off- and on-lattice models of polar and apolar alignment, and show how to obtain an on-lattice from an off-lattice model of velocity alignment. By characterizing the behaviour and dynamical description of collective migration models at the macroscopic level, we suggest the type of phase transitions and possible patterns in the approximative macroscopic partial differential equation descriptions as informative equivalence criteria between on- and off-lattice models.

At the core of these models are the numerical method used to update cell positions and the force functions that encode the pairwise mechanical interactions of cells. For the latter, there are multiple choices that could potentially affect both the biological behaviour captured, and the robustness and efficiency of simulation. For example, available open-source software implementations of centre-based models rely on different force functions for their default behaviour and it is not straightforward for a modeller to know if these are interchangeable. Our study addresses this problem and contributes to the understanding of the potential and limitations of three popular force functions from a numerical perspective. We show empirically that choosing the force parameters such that the relaxation time for two cells after cell division is consistent between different force functions results in good agreement of the population radius of a two-dimensional monolayer relaxing mechanically after intense cell proliferation. Furthermore, we report that numerical stability is not sufficient to prevent unphysical cell trajectories following cell division, and consequently, that too large time steps can cause geometrical differences at the population level.},

Here, we unveil "aspiration-assisted bioprinting (AAB)," which enables picking and bioprinting biologics in 3D through harnessing the power of aspiration forces, and when coupled with microvalve bioprinting, it facilitated different biofabrication schemes including scaffold-based or scaffold-free bioprinting at an unprecedented placement precision, ~11% with respect to the spheroid size. We studied the underlying physical mechanism of AAB to understand interactions between aspirated viscoelastic spheroids and physical governing forces during aspiration and bioprinting. We bioprinted a wide range of biologics with dimensions in an order-of-magnitude range including tissue spheroids (80 to 600 m), tissue strands (~800 m), or single cells (electrocytes, ~400 m), and as applications, we illustrated the patterning of angiogenic sprouting spheroids and self-assembly of osteogenic spheroids.},

   abstract = {Cellular models are needed to study human development and disease in vitro, and to screen drugs for toxicity and efficacy. Current approaches are limited in the engineering of functional tissue models with requisite cell densities and heterogeneity to appropriately model cell and tissue behaviors. Here, we develop a bioprinting approach to transfer spheroids into self-healing support hydrogels at high resolution, which enables their patterning and fusion into high-cell density microtissues of prescribed spatial organization. As an example application, we bioprint induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac microtissue models with spatially controlled cardiomyocyte and fibroblast cell ratios to replicate the structural and functional features of scarred cardiac tissue that arise following myocardial infarction, including reduced contractility and irregular electrical activity. The bioprinted in vitro model is combined with functional readouts to probe how various pro-regenerative microRNA treatment regimes influence tissue regeneration and recovery of function as a result of cardiomyocyte proliferation. This method is useful for a range of biomedical applications, including the development of precision models to mimic diseases and the screening of drugs, particularly where high cell densities and heterogeneity are important.},

   abstract = {Biological self-assembly is crucial in the processes of development, tissue regeneration, and maturation of bioprinted tissue-engineered constructions. The cell aggregates—spheroids—have become widely used model objects in the study of this phenomenon. Existing approaches describe the fusion of cell aggregates by analogy with the coalescence of liquid droplets and ignore the complex structural properties of spheroids. Here, we analyzed the fusion process in connection with structure and mechanical properties of the spheroids from human somatic cells of different phenotypes: mesenchymal stem cells from the limbal eye stroma and epithelial cells from retinal pigment epithelium. A nanoindentation protocol was applied for the mechanical measurements. We found a discrepancy with the liquid drop fusion model: the fusion was faster for spheroids from epithelial cells with lower apparent surface tension than for mesenchymal spheroids with higher surface tension. This discrepancy might be caused by biophysical processes such as extracellular matrix remodeling in the case of mesenchymal spheroids and different modes of cell migration. The obtained results will contribute to the development of more realistic models for spheroid fusion that would further provide a helpful tool for constructing cell aggregates with required properties both for fundamental studies and tissue reparation.},

We showed that while pairs of uniluminal vascular spheroids suspended in culture medium fused to form a larger diameter spheroidal structure, spheroids in collagen hydrogels formed elongated structures. These findings highlight the potential use of uniluminal vascular spheroids as modules to engineer blood vessels. We also demonstrate that uniluminal vascular spheroid fusion conforms to models describing the coalescence of liquid drops. Furthermore, the fusion of uniluminal vascular spheroids in vitro closely resembled the in vivo process by which the descending aorta forms from the fusion of the paired dorsal aortae during embryonic development. Together, the findings indicate that tissue liquidity underlies uniluminal vascular spheroid fusion and that in vivo anastomosis of blood vessels may involve a similar mechanism. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   abstract = {Organ printing or computer-aided robotic layer-by-layer additive biofabrication of thick three-dimensional (3D) living tissue constructs employing self-assembling tissue spheroids is a rapidly evolving alternative to classic solid scaffold-based approaches in tissue engineering. However, the absence of effective methods of accelerated tissue maturation immediately after bioprinting is the main technological imperative and potential impediment for further progress in the development of this emerging organ printing technology. Identification of the optimal combination of factors and conditions that accelerate tissue maturation ('maturogenic' factors) is an essential and necessary endeavour. Screening of maturogenic factors would be most efficiently accomplished using high-throughput quantitative in vitro tissue maturation assays. We have recently reviewed the formation of solid scaffold-free tissue constructs through the fusion of bioprinted tissue spheroids that have measurable material properties. We hypothesize that the fusion kinetics of these tissue spheroids will provide an efficacious in vitro assay of the level of tissue maturation. We report here the results of experimental testing of two simple quantitative tissue spheroid fusion-based in vitro high-throughput screening assays of tissue maturation: (a) a tissue spheroid envelopment assay; and (b) a tissue spheroid fusion kinetics assay.

   abstract = {A recently emerged approach for tissue engineering is to biofabricate tissues using cellular spheroids as building blocks. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), can be cultured to generate large numbers of cells and can presumably be differentiated into all the cell types of the human body in vitro, thus are an ideal cell source for biofabrication. We previously developed a hydrogel-based cell culture system that can economically produce large numbers of hPSC spheroids. With hPSCs and this culture system, there are two potential methods to biofabricate a desired tissue. In Method 1, hPSC spheroids are first utilized to biofabricate an hPSC tissue that is subsequently differentiated into the desired tissue. In Method 2, hPSC spheroids are first converted into tissue spheroids in the hydrogel-based culture system and the tissue spheroids are then utilized to biofabricate the desired tissue. In this paper, we systematically measured the fusion rates of hPSC spheroids without and with differentiation toward cortical and midbrain dopaminergic neurons and found spheroids' fusion rates dropped sharply as differentiation progressed. We found Method 1 was appropriate for biofabricating neural tissues.},

   abstract = {Background: Cell-based models are becoming increasingly popular for applications in developmental biology. However, the impact of numerical choices on the accuracy and efficiency of the simulation of these models is rarely meticulously tested. Without concrete studies to differentiate between solid model conclusions and numerical artifacts, modelers are at risk of being misled by their experiments’ results. Most cell-based modeling frameworks offer a feature-rich environment, providing a wide range of biological components, but are less suitable for numerical studies. There is thus a need for software specifically targeted at this use case. Results: We present CBMOS, a Python framework for the simulation of the center-based or cell-centered model. Contrary to other implementations, CBMOS’ focus is on facilitating numerical study of center-based models by providing access to multiple ordinary differential equation solvers and force functions through a flexible, user-friendly interface and by enabling rapid testing through graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration. We show-case its potential by illustrating two common workflows: (1) comparison of the numerical properties of two solvers within a Jupyter notebook and (2) measuring average wall times of both solvers on a high performance computing cluster. More specifically, we confirm that although for moderate accuracy levels the backward Euler method allows for larger time step sizes than the commonly used forward Euler method, its additional computational cost due to being an implicit method prohibits its use for practical test cases. Conclusions: CBMOS is a flexible, easy-to-use Python implementation of the center-based model, exposing both basic model assumptions and numerical components to the user. It is available on GitHub and PyPI under an MIT license. CBMOS allows for fast prototyping on a central processing unit for small systems through the use of NumPy. Using CuPy on a GPU, cell populations of up to 10,000 cells can be simulated within a few seconds. As such, it will substantially lower the time investment for any modeler to check the crucial assumption that model conclusions are independent of numerical issues.},

Here we introduce MecaGen, an integrative modelling platform enabling the hypothesis-driven simulation of these dual processes via the coupling between mechanical and chemical variables. Our approach relies upon a minimal'cell behaviour ontology' comprising mesenchymal and epithelial cells and their associated behaviours. MecaGen enables the specification and control of complex collective movements in 3D space through a biologically relevant gene regulatory network and parameter space exploration.

We present here a detailed description of the model, and use successive mean-field approximations to connect it to more coarse-grained approaches, such as discrete cell-based algorithms and coupled partial differential equations. We also discuss efficient algorithms for encoding the model, and give an example of a simulation of an epithelial sheet.

   abstract = {A distinguishing feature of a multicellular living system is that it operates at various scales, from the intracellular to organismal. Genes and molecules set up the conditions for the physical processes to act, in particular to shape the embryo. As development continues the changes brought about by the physical processes lead to changes in gene expression. It is this coordinated interplay between genetic and generic (i.e., physical and chemical) processes that constitutes the modern understanding of early morphogenesis. It is natural to assume that in this multiscale process the smaller defines the larger. In case of biophysical properties, in particular, those at the subcellular level are expected to give rise to those at the tissue level and beyond. Indeed, the physical properties of tissues vary greatly from the liquid to solid. Very little is known at present on how tissue level properties are related to cell and subcellular properties. Modern measurement techniques provide quantitative results at both the intracellular and tissue level, but not on the connection between these. In the present work we outline a framework to address this connection. We specifically concentrate on the morphogenetic process of tissue fusion, by following the coalescence of two contiguous multicellular aggregates. The time evolution of this process can accurately be described by the theory of viscous liquids. We also study fusion by Monte Carlo simulations and a novel Cellular Particle Dynamics (CPD) model, which is similar to the earlier introduced Subcellular Element Model (SEM; Newman, 2005). Using the combination of experiments, theory and modeling we are able to relate the measured tissue level biophysical quantities to subcellular parameters. Our approach has validity beyond the particular morphogenetic process considered here and provides a general way to relate biophysical properties across scales. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Tissue fusion is essential in bioprinting, an emergent technique based on computer-controlled delivery of multicellular building blocks and supportive hydrogels. The objective of this work was to predict the time course of the fusion of multicellular systems. Computational methods, including Lattice Boltzmann models, proved to be able to simulate in vitro morphogenesis. Here, a Hermite Lattice Boltzmann (HLB) model was used to simulate the sidewise fusion of contiguous cylinders made of cohesive cells in a hydrogel. Fusion eventually gave rise to a tubular construct, in qualitative agreement with 3D tissue printing experiments. Also, the HLB model accounted for the experimentally observed spontaneous rounding of irregular tissue fragments. Our numerical code was based on parallel computing, implemented using the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) libraries on nVidia M2090 Graphics Processing Unit blades, on lattices of up to 4096 × 4096 nodes. Importantly, the CUDA implementation was about 20 times faster than the parallel computation code written using the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc), running on a cluster of 32 central processing units. In conclusion, the CUDA version of the HLB model can be employed to simulate the post-printing evolution of bioprinted tissue constructs.},
